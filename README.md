<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">My journey in software engineering began at 15 when I attended Mihajlo Pupin High School, focusing on Information Technology. This early start sparked my passion for technology and built a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving. Now in my final year of a bachelor’s in Applied Software Engineering at the Faculty of Technical Sciences in Novi Sad, I’ve developed solid skills in object-oriented programming, algorithms, and data structures, as well as proficiency in C# and Python.</p>
